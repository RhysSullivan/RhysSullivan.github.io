				What is it: VR project running on the Oculus Quest that converts spin bike pedaling into in-game input. You race 60 other bikes in a lap around an island.
				<br>
				<br>
				Team Size: 1
				<br>

				Duration: 2 Weeks
				<br>
				<br>
				What I did: Programmed basic vehicle path finding code that would allow AI to stay on the course and react to other bikes coming near them. I also figured out how to convert input from an aux cord on the spin bike into in game movement through taking the average over a time of the intensity of the mic value. Project used a mix of C++ and blueprints.
